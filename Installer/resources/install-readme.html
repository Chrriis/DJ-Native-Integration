  <h2>What can it do for you?</h2>
  <p>The DJ Project is a set of utilities and extensions to the operating
  system. Their aim is to better integrate Java-based applications to the
  desktop.</p>
  <p>With the DJ Project, you can finally get proper icons for your Jar files,
  run executable Jar files as real processes and see these processes in the task
  manager with the appropriate names.<br/>
  Moreover, the DJ Project allows to tweak the integration behaviors, for
  example to customize the icons from an Ant task or a graphical
  user interface)</p>
