  <h1>The DJ Project - overview</h1>
  
  <h2>What it can do for you</h2>
  <p>The DJ Project is a set of utilities and extensions. Their aim is to better
  integrate Java-based applications to the desktop.</p>
  
  <h2>Integration?</h2>
  <p>With the DJ Project, you can finally get proper icons for your Jar files,
  run executable Jar files as real processes, and see these processes in the
  task manager.</p>
  <p>Moreover, it comes with some utilities to tweak the integration behaviors
  (for example, to customize the icons from an Ant task or a graphical user
  interface)</p>
