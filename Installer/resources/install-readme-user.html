  <h2>What can it do for you?</h2>
  <p>The DJ Project is a set of utilities and extensions to the operating system. Their aim is to better integrate Java-based applications to the desktop.</p>
  <p>The DJ Project brings:
    <ul>
      <li>Proper icon support for Jar files, with different icons to differentiate libraries and applications. The icons can be customized.</li>
      <li>The ability to run executable Jar files as real processes. See their name in the task manager, and have a proper task bar aggregation per program.</li>
      <li>Configuration of the default Virtual Machine arguments that an executable Jar file should use. Multiple sets of arguments can be defined to allow per vendor and/or runtime version configuration.</li>
      <li>The Tweak utility, to customize all the aspects described above, using its Ant task or its graphical user interface.</li>
      <li>An "Open in Shell" command in the contextual menu of a Jar file to launch it from a visible shell.</li>
      <li>A view of the manifest attributes of a Jar file from its properties.</li>
    </ul>
