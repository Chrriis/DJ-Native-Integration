1. What is the DJ Project?

The DJ Project is a set of tools to enhance the user experience provided by Java
on the desktop.

The main focus is on making rich client Java applications first class citizens
of the operating system.


2. How to use it?

The installer allows to decide which of the features to install. Most of the
features actually configure the environment automatically.

Some utilies can be accessed from the shortcuts in the Start menu if this option
was selected at install time.


3. What is the development status?

Several integrations to the Windows operating system and the necessary utilities
are implemented and seem stable. More extensions may come if we see a need.

About other operating systems support, we lack the competences to implement the
same functionalities. Nevertheless, the modifications affecting the files, like
the icon support for JAR files, are implemented with platform independance in
mind, so it is theoretically possible to implement it.
If someone with the necessary competences wants to contribute, just contact us!

For more detailed information about the current implementation status, visit
the DJ Project's website.


4. Troubleshooting

In case of a problem, due to the reinstallation of the Java runtime or issues
with the uninstaller for example, simply run the installer again: it will
restore a consistent system. In case of uninstaller problems, uninstalling
should work fine after the fresh re-installation.


5. Sources?

The sources are part of the source distribution and on SourceForge.
